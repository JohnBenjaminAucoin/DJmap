we have a list of songs
convert camelot to readable format



camelot 
(12, 1) (11, 1) (10, 1) (9, 1) (8, 1) (7, 1) (8, 1) (6, 1) (5, 1) (4, 1) (3, 1) (2, 1) (1, 1)
(12, 0) (11, 0) (10, 0) (9, 0) (8, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (6, 0) (5, 0) (4, 0) (3, 0) (2, 0) (1, 0)

we create an array of nodes 1 for each song



node: 
    -song title
    -center coordinates
    -camelot key

array of connections

connection: 
        -start point
        -end point
        -strength
strength:
        high
      3  same camelot
      2  note off by 1
      2  change letter
      1  note + 2
      1  note off by one and change letter
        low


for each node we create n-1 connections to each other node

    first node, connect to every other node
    second node, every other node except 1
    etc







create the graph:
